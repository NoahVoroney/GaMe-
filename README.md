update the above program to have 2 DIFFERENT images move around the screen in different directions, at different speeds
try making one image FADE OUT and the other FADE IN
try making one image GROW and the other image SHRINK
try making one image move RIGHT and the other move LEFT or DIAGONALLY
try making one of the images SPIN as it moves across the screen
try making one image move in a parabolic trajectory
